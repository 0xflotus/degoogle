#### Search (web, images)

| Name | Eyes | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) | **5-eyes** | One of the best privacy-focused search engines. Domain is hosted in USA which could potentially be problematic for some. |
| [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/) | **9-eyes** | Another privacy search engine that claims to not track any of your data. They operate servers in both USA and Europe. Note: Startpage was recently acquired. See [Issue #12](https://github.com/tycrek/degoogle/issues/12). Thanks @pydo, @ThijsRay, and @DatAres37. Also see [this comment in Issue #99](https://github.com/tycrek/degoogle/issues/99#issuecomment-616224650) from @danarel on Startpage. |
| [searx.me](https://searx.me/) |  | [Open-source](https://github.com/asciimoo/searx) (thanks for clarification u/Sheezdudeln) privacy search engine. Domain hosted in Germany. |

| [Swisscows](https://swisscows.ch) |  | A Swiss search engine that offers a unique search experience for the web, images, videos, music, and more. They are currently funding a mail service. Read through their [datacenter about page](https://swisscows.ch/en/datacenter), it's really interesting. |
| [Mojeek](https://www.mojeek.com/) | **5-eyes** | Unlike other privacy search engines which act as a "middle man" between you and Google/Bing/Yahoo, Mojeek has their own crawler and index. The results aren't as complete as some of the others, but it is still impressive and they are actively building their index to include more results with better accuracy. |
| [Ekoru](https://ekoru.org/) |  | Privacy focused search engine that also aims to clean up the oceans. Thanks @mynamesleon |

| [Infinity Search](https://infinitysearch.co/) | **5-eyes** | Infinity Search is a privacy metasearch engine that does not log any information about its users.

Also offers downloads in many formats for videos (including `.vtt` subtitles). |
| [Hooktube](https://hooktube.com/) |  | A slightly better way to use actual YouTube. (Use as a "last resort") |
| [LBRY](https://lbry.com/) |  | A decentralized platform for distributing and supporting creators's work. It aims to be Open, Community driven "digital marketplace". It can be used in a similar way to YouTube: browsing, subscribing to channels, there is a mechanism to send "tips" to creators. Looks up videos based on a blockchain and is open source and uncensored. It already has some "larger" creators like Minutephysics, Veritasium, Barnacules and Lunduke. |

## Desktop apps

#### Chrome

| Name | Eyes | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| [Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium) |  | Chromium (which Chrome and countless other browsers are built on top of) is one of the cleanest and light-weight browsers available. This version cuts out all the Google crap. |
| [Firefox](https://firefox.com/) |  | Built by Mozilla, "The Privacy Company". Huge extension library; great for privacy. |
| [Waterfox](https://www.waterfox.net/) | **5-eyes** | Based on Firefox, but **64-bit only** with an emphasis on speed and privacy. Has a "classic" version built off older Firefox for legacy extension support and also an "alpha" version built off Quantum. It doesn't collect any telemetry and also removes Pocket from the alpha release. Project is run by [Alex Kontos](https://github.com/MrAlex94/) and is constantly in active development. Looks very clean and fast. Android versions are in the works too. **UPDATE:** @Nudin pointed out in Issue #85 that Waterfox is now [apart of System1](https://www.waterfox.net/blog/waterfox-has-joined-system1/). |
| [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) |  | Privacy-focused browser. Appears to be very customizable and feature-rich. |
| [Tor Browser](null) |  | Firefox-based browser routed through the onion network. Automatically has a few privacy extensions installed (such as HTTPS Everywhere). Be careful using it in public though, as it *can* look like a pretty suspicious piece of software. Available for Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android. |

| [KDE Marble](https://kde.org/applications/education/org.kde.marble) |  | Strong alternative for G Earth. Currently only on Linux, but is being ported to other platforms. Thanks to @PopeRigby |
