## Mobile applications (mobile apps installable from stores)

When searching for replacements, check the alternative stores (such as F-Droid) before checking the Play Store.

- Play Store
  - [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) - Catalogue of FOSS apps for Android. Easy to install and keeps track of updates. Also has a browser version if you don't want to install the app.
  - [Aptoide](https://www.aptoide.com/) - Marketplace for Android apps. Publishers/developers manage their own stores rather than a centralized market such as Google Play Store.
  - [Yalp Store](https://github.com/yeriomin/YalpStore) - Yalp downloads Play Store apps as APK files. Helpful if you want to stay away from the Play Store, but require an app that is only available there.
  - [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/) - An online library of user-uploaded APK files. Helpful if you need a specific older version of an app or don't want to download it through Google Play.
  - [Aurora Store](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AuroraStore) - Aurora Store is ~~simply a fork of the Yalp Store~~ no longer a fork of Yalp, but is now its own project (see their [readme](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AuroraStore/blob/master/README.md)). **Update:** Removed note on using microG as Aurora Store [does not use it](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AuroraStore/-/blob/master/README.md#L77). Thanks @RefexHD & @notpushkin
  - [Fossdroid](https://fossdroid.com/) - Uses the same library as F-Droid, but with a modern UI similar to that of the Play Store and the ability to view apps by popularity.
  - [G-Droid](https://gitlab.com/gdroid/gdroidclient/) - Also uses the F-Droid repo but with a different UI.
  - [APKGrabber](https://github.com/hemker/apkgrabber) - Fork of [APKUpdater](https://github.com/rumboalla/apkupdater). Both are great tools for avoiding app stores (on Android).
  - [Aurora Droid](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-aurora-droid-fdroid-client-t3932663) - Yet another F-Droid client, potentially has a few bugs (thanks u/OfficialJohnGL4)

  - [Fennec F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/) - A privacy-focused version of Firefox Android available on F-Droid. It's focused on removing any proprietary bits found in official Mozilla's builds. (thanks u/SupremeLisper)

App itself is no longer in development, but the developer does [encourage pull requests](https://github.com/tranleduy2000/ncalc#calculator-n---powerful-calculator-for-android). I've used it frequently and it works great. Not on F-Droid, but a 3rd party play store can probably find it; or the APK's are available as releases on GitHub. You can also compile from source.
- Calendar
  - [Fruux (mobile app)](https://fruux.com/) - Same service from above provides an Android app.
  - [Etar](https://github.com/xsoh/Etar-Calendar) - Open-source material design Calendar that integrates with the Android Calendar API.

Also look at [ICSx5](https://icsx5.bitfire.at/), another WebDav/CalDav client that can integrate with calendar apps. Also available from F-Droid. Thanks @je-vv for ICSx5.
- Camera
  - [Open Camera](https://opencamera.sourceforge.io/) - Open source camera for Android. Thanks @je-vv
- Clock
  - [Clock +](https://github.com/philliphsu/ClockPlus) - Open-source Alarm clock, timer, and stop watch. Available from F-Droid.

  - [Insane Alarm!](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/insane-alarm) - Developer states that he had "spent a night out with the boys and drank a bit too much but needed to be up in the morning". So, he made the loudest alarm clock possible based off an emergency alarm from when he was in the military. This app doesn't mess around, use it wisely.
- Contacts
  - [Fruux (mobile app)](https://fruux.com/) - Fruux *also* provides a contacts app.

- Maps/Waze
  - Don't use Waze. It's owned by Google.
  - [Maps](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.axet.maps/) - Available from F-Droid. Open-source navigation app based on MAPS.ME. Searching for addresses doesn't always work and finding businesses can be a slight hassle, but overall one of the better apps I've used.
  - [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/) - OpenStreetMap for Android. (thanks u/masao77)
    - As OsmAnd is primarily crowdsourced, many regions may not be totally accurate. If you would like to help improve OpenStreetMap and OsmAnd, check out [StreetComplete](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/StreetComplete). It is available from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.westnordost.streetcomplete/).
